# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, we encourage to first discuss the change you wish to make via (issue)[adsdf] before 
submitting a change. We're not strict about this and for small changes feel free to raise PR directly.

## Pull Request Process

- Ensure any local configuration in `build.gradle.kts` for running the plugin is removed.
- Aim to keep PR scoped to one feature for ease of review.
- For new features or changed features, update the `README.md` and `plugin.xml` accordingly.
- Use the default IDE code formatting settings.
